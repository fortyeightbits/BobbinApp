# BobbinApp
When I started sewing garments as a hobby I was surprised to find that there wasn't an existing mobile app that could keep track of one's fabric and notion inventory or project tracking (at least, one that didn't look like it was designed by a potato). I'm an embedded engineer at heart with zero experience in web or app development so I wasn't ready to launch The Ultimate Sewing App on my own, but I did want to challenge myself and see if I could pick up app development from scratch and make a simple CRUD app to track the fabric stash I have and planned projects.

After much sweat and tears, Bobbin was created using React Native with Expo. It features two submenus, one for tracking fabric type and yardage, and one for planned/completed sewing projects with fields to keep track of the amount of fabric needed and any reference photos. Stored data is saved locally on the phone using SQLite.
